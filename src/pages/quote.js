          Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas.

          As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not
          certain, and as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.

          Without mathematics, thereâ€™s nothing you can do. Everything around you
          is mathematics. Everything around you is numbers.

          We will always have STEM with us. Some things will drop out of the
          public eye and go away, but there will always be science, engineering,
          and technology. And there will always, always be mathematics.
          <span>Katherine Johnson</span>

        <blockquote className="otro-blockquote fadeInBottom">
          Mathematics as an expression of the human mind reflects the active
          will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic
          perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and
          construction, generality and individuality.
